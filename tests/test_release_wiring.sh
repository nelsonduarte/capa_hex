# Regression test for how .github/workflows/release.yml CALLS the shared
# release guards.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The guards themselves are tested where they live, in
# the compiler repository. What is NOT tested there, and cannot be, is
# whether a consumer wired them up in a way that actually gates
# anything. A `guards:` job that runs and reports failure while the
# release publishes anyway is worse than no guard at all: it produces a
# green-looking gate, a red job nobody reads, and a published artefact.
# That is the same shape as the defects the guards exist to catch,
# verification that proves nothing about the thing it appears to cover.
#
# The wiring can break in ways that no YAML parser and no linter calls
# an error, because every one of them is a VALID workflow:
#
#   * pinning a tag or a branch instead of a commit, so the guard can be
#     edited under us;
#   * pinning a well-formed SHA that does not exist, so every release
#     fails at dispatch, or worse, resolves to something unintended;
#   * dropping `needs: guards`, so the two jobs race and the release can
#     publish before the guards finish;
#   * `continue-on-error` or a job-level `if: always()`, so the guards
#     run, fail, and block nothing.
#
# Run it directly:
#
#   bash tests/test_release_wiring.sh
#
# `capa test` runs the .capa files in tests/ and ignores this one.
#
# Deliberately grep and awk based: it needs nothing installed and runs
# anywhere the release runs. The one check that needs the network (does
# the pinned commit exist, and does it carry the workflow file) reports
# SKIP rather than failing when `gh` is unavailable or unauthenticated,
# because an offline machine cannot answer that question and a test that
# guesses is the failure mode this whole file is about.
#
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# THIS FILE IS MEANT TO BE SHARED ACROSS REPOSITORIES.
#
# It was derived from capa_authgate's copy, which hardcoded that
# repository's own shape: `main.capa`, `service.capa` and
# `tools/nest_vendor.py`. Copied verbatim into any other package those
# three assertions are false, and the nest_vendor one is false in EVERY
# other repository in the fleet, because no other package has a
# two-level dependency graph. A shared test whose assertions have to be
# edited per repository is a shared test that will be edited wrongly.
#
# So everything repo-specific has been lifted into the CONFIG block
# below and everything under it is intended to be byte-identical
# everywhere. Adopting this file in a new package means editing the
# config block and nothing else. If you find yourself editing below the
# line, that is a signal the config block is missing a dimension, and
# the fix is to add one rather than to fork the body.

# ================== CONFIG: the only repo-specific part ==================

# Entry points the clean room must COMPILE, in the order the flow runs
# them. For a library this is the library module plus any documented
# runnable example; for an application it is each executable entry.
ENTRY_POINTS=(hex.capa example.capa)

# Entry points whose CAPABILITY CEILING the clean room must check.
#
# Leave this EMPTY for a package that declares no `[capabilities]` table
# in capa.toml, and the body below will then require that the flow does
# NOT run `--check-capabilities` at all. That is not pedantry: with no
# ceiling declared the command prints
#
#   capa: --check-capabilities: no package declares a [capabilities]
#         ceiling; nothing to verify.
#
# and exits 0. A step that always passes having inspected nothing is
# precisely the class of defect the release guards exist to abolish, and
# it is worse than omitting the step, because the log looks like
# evidence. The body cross-checks this list against capa.toml so the two
# cannot disagree.
CEILING_ENTRIES=(hex.capa example.capa)

# Does the consumer flow need `python tools/nest_vendor.py`?
#
# Only for a package with a TWO-LEVEL dependency graph: the ceiling gate
# looks for a dependency's own dependencies under `vendor/<dep>/vendor/`
# while `capa install` vendors flat. At the time of writing exactly one
# repository in the fleet needs it (capa_authgate). Set to "yes" there
# and "no" everywhere else; when it is "no" the body REQUIRES the line
# to be absent, so a copy-paste of someone else's flow is caught rather
# than silently carried along.
