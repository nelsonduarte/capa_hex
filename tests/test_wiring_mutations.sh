# Mutation test for tests/test_release_wiring.sh.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The wiring test reports "53 passed, 0 failed", and
# that number says how many assertions RAN. It says nothing about how
# many of them BITE. An adversarial audit of this repository applied
# three edits by hand, each of which leaves a release checking less than
# it claims, and all three passed green:
#
#   * an entry point typo'd identically in the config and in the flow,
#     so both agree about a file that does not exist;
#   * a ceiling entry dropped from both, so a module is silently no
#     longer covered;
#   * an entry point dropped entirely, same effect, no trace.
#
# Separately, an adoption of the shared body onto capa_base64 performed
# exactly as the checklist instructs produced 52 green assertions on a
# repository still declaring `capa = ">=1.1.0"`, a floor that CANNOT
# build the package at all.
#
# A guard nobody has ever seen fail is a guard nobody has evidence
# about. So each mutation below is applied to a scratch copy of this
# repository, the wiring test is run there, and it is required to FAIL.
# The unmutated control is required to PASS, which is what rules out the
# harness reporting success because the test errored for its own
# reasons.
#
# Run it directly:
#
#   bash tests/test_wiring_mutations.sh
#
# `capa test` runs the .capa files in tests/ and ignores this one.
